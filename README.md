# Ada95 Language Processor
## Construction of AST from Ada95 files

Developed by [Iván Álvarez López](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/ialnavy/> "LinkedIn profile of Iván Álvarez López") using ANTLR 4.7.2 in Java 8.

Credits to the contributors in the creation of the [original ANTLR4 grammar for Ada95](<https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/ada/ada95> "ANTLR4 grammar for Ada95"), which I extended for implementing Java classes for each AST node.
